Hello, World.  I am not quite sure why I am saying "Hello" to the world.  
I am quite certain the world doesn't really care about any single person
to pay any attention to the fact that I am greeting it let alone care or 
respond, given the vast number of inhabitants the world has on its back.
How many others are saying "Hello" to the world at the exat same time?
It must get quite confusing with so many speaking at once.  That brings
me to another question.  Now that I have greeted the world, what should I
say to continue into a conversation?  What topic would the world find to
be an interesting one to discuss?  I'm probably overthinking it.  The 
world is probably too busy to speak with me anyway, so hello, world.
I'm just going to go back to what I was doing and let you get back to
whatever worldly things you need to get done.  I just wanted to be
courteous and offer greeting.  If you, at any point, have something
you would like to talk about or just shoot the breeze, you know where
I am.
