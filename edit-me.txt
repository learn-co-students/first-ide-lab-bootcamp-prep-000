Good Evening People 
I have been coding now for two consecutive days
I believe I could be really great at this
However, there are a lot of things that I still find confusing 
First, what do I begin with? Do I jump straight to a header or is there pretext?
Second, why are we typing in the text file now and not just going into the code?
Finally, why do codes have children and grandchildren?
