  For every lab, the workflow you will use to solve it is:
  
  <br>

  1. Open the lab by clicking the "Open" button.
  
  <br>

  2. Read the README of the lab and get a sense of what the lab wants you to do.
  
  <br>

  3. Run the tests with <code>learn</code> from your terminal.
  
  <br>

  4. Open any files you need to edit using the File Tree.
  
  <br>

  5. Write code in the Text Editor that will satisfy the lab requirements.
  
  <br>

  6. Run the <code>learn</code> command in your Terminal as many times as you need to get feedback.
  
  <br>

  7. Once the tests are passing or even if you're just done for the day, submit the lab with <code>learn submit</code>.
  
  <br>

  8. If you ever get stuck, use "Ask a Question" to get help, don't be shy!
